Stock Synthesis (SS ver. 3.30) class practice

This repository is being used to store and keep track of changes to SS parameter input files and output.

Chiliean jack mackerel data are used as inputs. The current assessment (http://www.sprfmo.int/assets/2019-SC7/Reports/SC7-Report-Annex-8-JM-Tech-Annex-Rev1.pdf) and information on the species (http://www.sprfmo.int/assets/Fisheries/Species-Profiles/SC-01-23-rev2-Jack-Mackerel-species-profile-pdf.pdf) are available. The current assessment process does not run on SS, so this is a nice exercise.
